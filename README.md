## Abstract:
The aim of this thesis is to design and implement a real-time strategy game in a 3D world with emphasis on high modifiability using a suitable scripting language. Inspired by the Dungeon Keeper series developed by Bullfrog Studios, the player's goal in this game is to protect his dungeon from endless armies of heroes raiding his domain with intentions to steal his treasures.

Once finished, the game's scripting engine should offer the ability to change data and logic of entities and systems to people with at least a basic understanding of programming. This will lead into easy future extensibility of the game and the possibility to create easily installable modifications.
