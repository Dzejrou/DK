\subsection*{Abstract\+:}

The goal of this thesis is to design and implement a real-\/time strategy game in a 3D world with emphasis on high modifiability using a suitable scripting language. Inspired by the Dungeon Keeper series developed by Bullfrog Studios, the player\textquotesingle{}s goal in this game is to protect his dungeon from endless armies of heroes raiding his domain with intentions to steal his treasures.

Once finished, the game\textquotesingle{}s scripting engine should offer the ability to change data and logic of entities and systems to people with at least a basic understanding of programming. This will lead to easy future extensibility of the game and the possibility to create easily installable modifications.
