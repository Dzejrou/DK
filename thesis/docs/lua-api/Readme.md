--- The Dungeon Throne modding API reference                                 ---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains reference files for the modding API of the game
The Dungeon Throne in which we can find list of all functions in the API and
their descriptions.

The name of each file is in the form of <table>.txt and functions listed in it
can be accessed through the table <table>. E.g. if the file some-table.txt
contains function some-function we can call this function as
some-table.some-function().

TODO: Add types to arguments.
